Return ONLY the result as a JSON object with keys: 'options' (a list of 4 strings), and 'answer_index' (the index of the correct answer in the list, 0-based). Do not include any explanation or text outside the JSON.
RESPONSE:
```json
{
  "options": [
    "Forest and desert ecosystems",
    "Urban and agricultural ecosystems",
    "Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems",
    "Oceanic and atmospheric ecosystems"
  ],

PROMPT:
Given the following question and answer, generate 4 MCQ options (A, B, C, D) where one is correct and the other three are distractors. Make the 3 incorrect options totally different from the correct answer.
Question: If the charge on sphere A is doubled, how will the force on sphere B change?
Correct Answer: The force on sphere B will double as well, because the force is directly proportional to the charge on sphere A.
Return ONLY the result as a JSON object with keys: 'options' (a list of 4 strings), and 'answer_index' (the index of the correct answer in the list, 0-based). Do not include any explanation or text outside the JSON.
RESPONSE:
```json
{
  "options": [
    "The force on sphere B will remain the same.",
    "The force on sphere B will be halved.",
    "The force on sphere B will quadruple.",
    "The force on sphere B will decrease proportionally to the square root of the charge change."

Question: Provide an example of how euglenoids adapt to different environmental conditions.
Correct Answer: Euglenoids adapt to different environmental conditions by switching their mode of nutrition. In the presence of sunlight, they perform photosynthesis like plants. However, when sunlight is not available, they can act as heterotrophs, consuming organic matter to meet their energy needs. This dual capability allows them to thrive in both light and dark conditions.

Question: Provide an example of a neurotransmitter and explain its role in the transmission of nerve impulses at a chemical synapse.
Correct Answer: An example of a neurotransmitter is acetylcholine. At a chemical synapse, acetylcholine is released from the pre-synaptic neuron, crosses the synaptic cleft, and binds to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron. This binding triggers the opening of ion channels, leading to the depolarization of the post-synaptic neuron and the continuation of the nerve impulse.
